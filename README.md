- 👋 Hi, I’m @niallist
- 👀 I’m interested in **blockchain**, overoptimising, and spending way too long prettifying xmonad!
- :heart: I have a particular love for anything related to the **Arweave** project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Rust**, **Typescript** & **Tauri**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting.
- 📫 You can reach me on **niall@decentapps.eu**.
